book the first  recalled to life




i

the period


it was the best of times it was the worst of times
it was the age of wisdom it was the age of foolishness
it was the epoch of belief it was the epoch of incredulity
it was the season of light it was the season of darkness
it was the spring of hope it was the winter of despair
we had everything before us we had nothing before us
we were all going direct to heaven we were all going direct
the other way  in short the period was so far like the present
period that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its
being received for good or for evil in the superlative degree
of comparison only

there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face
on the throne of england there were a king with a large jaw and
a queen with a fair face on the throne of france  in both
countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the state
preserves of loaves and fishes that things in general were
settled for ever
