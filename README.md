# Introduction-to-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
This repository contains solutions to the selected Java programming exercises from the book "Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach". Exercises were a part of the course CS201.

Every exercise solution has a program description, inputs and expected outputs. Also, most of the comprehensive programs contain information about the dependencies, while basic ones do not. To download any skipped dependencies, visit the booksite, and look for the necessary file (e.g. StdOut.java).

You can use the textbook for additional reference.

Feel free to contribute to the repository with new solutions or bug fixes.
